# SNAP — Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program

**Agency:** USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)
**Regulation:** [7 CFR Part 273](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/part-273)
**Fiscal Year:** FY2026 (October 1, 2025 – September 30, 2026)

## Eligibility Rules Overview

SNAP eligibility for most households requires passing three tests:

| Test | Rule | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Gross income | 7 CFR 273.9(a)(1) | ≤ 130% FPL |
| Net income | 7 CFR 273.9(a)(2) | ≤ 100% FPL |
| Assets | 7 CFR 273.8(b) | ≤ $2,500 general / ≤ $4,500 elderly or disabled |

**Exceptions:** Elderly/disabled households skip the gross income test. Households with TANF/SSI recipients skip all income tests (categorical eligibility). Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE) states waive the asset test.

### Standard Deductions (FY2026, 48 States + DC)

| Household Size | Standard Deduction |
|---|---|
| 1–3 | $209/month |
| 4 | $223/month |
| 5 | $261/month |
| 6+ | $299/month |

### Net Income Calculation (7 CFR 273.9(c))

```
Net income = Gross income
           − 20% earned income deduction    [273.9(c)(1)]
           − Standard deduction             [273.9(c)(2)]
           − Dependent care deduction       [273.9(c)(3)]
           − Medical expense deduction*     [273.9(c)(4)]
           − Excess shelter deduction†      [273.9(c)(5)]
```

\* Medical deduction applies only to elderly/disabled households; expenses over $35/month.
† Excess shelter deduction is capped at $744/month unless the household contains an elderly or disabled member.

## Presets

| Preset | State | Asset Test | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `snap.va` | Virginia | Strict ($2,500) | Default for most examples |
| `snap.ca` | California | Waived (BBCE) | No asset test |
| `snap.tx` | Texas | Strict ($2,500) | |
| `snap.md` | Maryland | Waived (BBCE) | |

BBCE states are tracked in `govsynth/sources/us/snap.py::BBCE_STATES`. See `USDA FNS State Options Report` for the current list.

## Profile Strategies

```python
Pipeline.from_preset("snap.va", profile_strategy="edge_saturated")
# 80% threshold-boundary profiles, 20% special-population edge cases
# Recommended for stress-testing LLM reasoning

Pipeline.from_preset("snap.va", profile_strategy="realistic")
# Census ACS distributions — representative of real applicants
# Requires: govsynth refresh-census-data --state VA

Pipeline.from_preset("snap.va", profile_strategy="uniform")
# National approximations, no census data required
```

---

## Edge Cases

The `edge_saturated` strategy generates two pools of cases:

- **80% threshold-boundary cases** — income or assets placed exactly at, just above, or just below a threshold boundary
- **20% special-population cases** — real-world scenarios where standard rules don't apply

### Threshold-Boundary Types

| Type | What it tests |
|---|---|
| `gross_income_limit` | Gross income at 130% FPL |
| `net_income_limit` | Net income at 100% FPL |
| `asset_limit_general` | Assets at $2,500 (strict-test states only) |
| `asset_limit_elderly_disabled` | Assets at $4,500 (elderly/disabled households) |

### Special-Population Edge Cases

These are the scenarios LLMs most commonly misapply. Each is implemented as a dedicated builder that constructs a `TestCase` with a multi-step `RationaleTrace` citing the specific CFR rule.

| Edge Case | CFR Citation | Key Policy Rule | Common Model Error |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Homeless shelter deduction** | 7 CFR 273.9(c)(6) | Flat $198.99 deduction applied **instead of** the excess shelter deduction — these are mutually exclusive | Applies the excess shelter formula to a homeless household instead of substituting the flat deduction |
| **Student exclusion** | 7 CFR 273.5(a),(b) | A student enrolled at least half-time is **ineligible** unless a 273.5(b) exception applies (20+ hrs/week work, single parent, TANF, work-study). Check fires **before** the income test | Skips the student status check; income-eligible student incorrectly passes |
| **Boarder income proration** | 7 CFR 273.1(b)(7) | Only the **profit** portion of board payments counts as income (payment received minus actual cost of food/housing provided) | Counts the full board payment as income instead of only the profit |
| **Migrant income averaging** | 7 CFR 273.10(c)(3) | Seasonal/migrant income is averaged over the **work period**, not taken as a current-month snapshot | Uses current-month income (zero between jobs) or annualizes incorrectly |
| **Mixed immigration status** | 7 CFR 273.4(c)(3) | Ineligible (non-qualified alien) members are excluded from **household size** for limit lookup, but their income counts **in full** | Either prorates the ineligible member's income (that's the sponsored noncitizen rule at 273.11(c)(3)) or includes them in household size |
| **Categorical eligibility (TANF/SSI)** | 7 CFR 273.2(j)(2); 7 CFR 273.11(c) | Households with TANF/SSI recipients are categorically eligible — the income test is **skipped entirely** | Runs the income test anyway and returns ineligible for above-limit households |

See [`EDGE_CASES.md`](../../EDGE_CASES.md) at the repo root for full documentation of each case including examples and planned future cases.

## Generating SNAP Cases

```python
from govsynth import Pipeline

# Standard generation — edge-saturated (default)
pipeline = Pipeline.from_preset("snap.va")
cases = pipeline.generate(n=100, seed=42)

# Inspect special-population cases
special = [c for c in cases if any(
    tag in c.variation_tags for tag in [
        "homeless_shelter_deduction",
        "student_exclusion",
        "boarder_income_proration",
        "migrant_income_averaging",
        "mixed_immigration_status_hh_size_reduction",
        "categorical_eligibility_tanf_ssi",
    ]
)]
print(f"{len(special)} special-population cases in this batch")
```

```bash
# CLI
govsynth generate snap.va --n 100 --seed 42 --output ./output/

# Inspect variation tags across the batch
govsynth generate snap.va --n 100 --seed 42 --format jsonl | \
  jq -r '.variation_tags[]' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```
